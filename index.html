    <h1>ABOUT ME.</h1>
    <p>My name is Pravin Rajanayagam, I'm a recent engineering graduate from Toronto Metropolitain University (Ryerson University). I found a love for the creation of technology in my undergraduate year and wanted to go into a field where I could challenge myself to create innovative new ideas and improve current technology.  I have 4 years of research experience from both Brock University and Toronto Metropolitan University. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I investigated the roles of internally stored calcium in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) muscle contractions. Though my prior background in neuroscience was limited, I challenged myself to learn about the subject through literature searches and completing comprehensive reports on the subject, ultimately finding innovative ways to better my understanding to have a successful project. I had a similar experience during my graduate work at Ryerson in which I was given a project that required me to self-learn different engineering software programs such as ANSYS, COMSOL, and MATLAB.  I accomplished designing a miniature inductive pressure sensor prototype that will lead to future fabrication and clinical testing. I have learned valuable skills throughout my career such as project management, team leading and building, data analysis/handling, and problem-solving. I am constantly finding new ways to advance my knowledge such as learning different design software to improve my design skills and learning Python, to better aid in recording data, creating algorithms, and data analysis. In the future, I aspire to work for a company that helps people with disabilities by inventing implants/prosthetics that are sturdy and more cost-efficient. During my graduate degree, I self-learned different engineering software programs and successfully designed a miniature LC pressure sensing device that will later be fabricated and tested</p>
